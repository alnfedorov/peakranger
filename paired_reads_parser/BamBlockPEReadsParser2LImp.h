 * This parser works as long as the bam file is sorted

 * The parser assumes two adjacent reads have the same
 * read name so they form a read pair. This is true when
 * the bam file is sorted by read name. (-n in samtools sort)
 * When this assumption does not hold, the parser will
 * still be able to make pseudo pairs out of two adjacent reads.
 * It depends on the user to decide if this behavior is
 * OK.
