    #Changes in version 1.18:
    * Added a new broad peak calling module: BCP
    * peakranger-ranger now generates a stable number of peaks
    * Fixed a bug that freezes peakranger-ccat
    * Fixed a bug that freezes peakranger when generating HTML reports
    * Fixed several typos in system messages.

    #Changes in version 1.17:
    * Fixed the bug of peakranger-wig that causes it not put output
    any files.
    * Created shell based tests

    #Changes in version 1.16:
    * --gzip and --strand options for wig. --gzip enables gzipped
    wig files. --strand enables one wig per strand.
    * the output file *_details now contains the number of reads from
    both sample and control.

    #Changes in version 1.15:
    * Wig files generated by ranger no longer contains
    the "viewLimit" item. This allows browser's automatic scaling.
    * An -q/--FDR option is added to enable FDR corrected p values.
    * Now outputs three files, summits, regions and all. Each file
    contains details about the used parameters.
    * The signaldumper utility is disabled for MAC OSX.
    * Modified makefile for MAC OSX.
    * Now allows ranger to run in solo-core systems.

    #Changes in version 1.14:
    * Fixed the problem when you specify the output as "foo".
    previously this will lead ranger to set the output as "/",
    which should instead be "./"

    * Sam parser now rejects reads mapped to "*" or "" and " "

    * In wig, if the output name is specified as foo, then wig will
    generate two files, foo(containing nothing) and foo.wig. Now
    it only generates foo.wig

    #Changes in version 1.13:
    * Fixed a lethal bug in sam parser so that read length is set

    #Changes in version 1.12:
    * No longer depends on boost::filesystem

    * Significant less memory consumption
    * Codes now only rely on Boost
